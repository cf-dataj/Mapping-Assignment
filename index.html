      <p> As if living in the state with the highest property taxes in the nation is not enough, Essex County residents also pay the highest taxes in New Jersey. Essex County and Bergen County residents paid the highest median taxes (over $10,000 a
        year) over a five-year span, according to the US Census Bureau. </p>

      <p> The State of New Jersey also reports that last year, the two counties had the highest residential property taxes. On average, Essex County residents had the highest tax bill: $12,531, followed by Bergen County: $12,009. </p>

      <p>So why do Essex County residents pay the highest taxes?</p>
